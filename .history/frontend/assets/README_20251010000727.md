Assets folder structure:

- images/    -> store hero images, barber photos, user avatars (e.g. hero-barber.jpg, barber1.jpg, user-placeholder.png)
- icons/     -> small SVG or PNG icons (nav icons, action icons)
- fonts/     -> any custom webfonts
- uploads/   -> runtime/uploads (user-submitted images); should be ignored by VCS

Tips:
- Add images to `assets/images/` and update `views/` to reference them (e.g. `assets/images/hero-barber.jpg`).
- Add `frontend/assets/uploads` to `.gitignore` when you start handling uploads.
